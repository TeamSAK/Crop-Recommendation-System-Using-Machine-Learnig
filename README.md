# Crop-recommendation-system
The crop recommendation system using machine learning is an intelligent decision support system that provides recommendations to farmers on the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil and weather conditions like temperature, humidity, rainfall, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and pH value of the soil.

Crop Recommendation System
A Crop Recommendation System is a type of agricultural decision support system that leverages data analytics and machine learning techniques to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crops to cultivate on their land. The system analyzes various factors such as soil quality, climate conditions, and crop requirements to make personalized recommendations to farmers.
Here's how a Crop Recommendation System works:
Dataset:
The dataset appears to contain information related to various agricultural crops.
Features include levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall.
There are a total of 2200 entries with 8 columns, where the label column represents the type of crop.
Preprocessing Steps:
The dataset undergoes some preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and suitability for machine learning models.
Missing values: There are no missing values in the dataset as indicated by the crop.isnull().sum() output.
Data types: The dataset primarily consists of numeric values with one categorical column (label).
Duplicates: There are no duplicate rows in the dataset as indicated by the crop.duplicated().sum() output.
Scaling: MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler are applied to scale the features before training machine learning models.
Models Explaining:
The best algorithm for a specific dataset involves experimentation and evaluation. Here's a brief assessment of KNN and Logistic Regression for the given dataset:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm suitable for classification tasks.
It makes predictions based on the majority class of the K nearest neighbors in the feature space.
KNN doesn't make assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
However, KNN can be sensitive to irrelevant or noisy features, and it may suffer from the curse of dimensionality, particularly with high-dimensional data.
Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is a classic algorithm for binary classification tasks.
It models the probability of the input belonging to each class using a logistic function.
Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the log-odds of the outcome.
It's interpretable and works well when the decision boundary is linearly separable.
However, Logistic Regression may not perform well if the relationship between features and the target variable is highly non-linear.
Problem Identification:
The problem seems to be a classification task aimed at predicting the appropriate crop based on environmental factors such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall.
The task involves training machine learning models to classify crops accurately based on these features.
The document mentions the usage of Logistic Regression and KNN models for prediction, indicating a supervised learning approach.
Overall, the document outlines a machine learning project focused on recommending suitable crops based on environmental factors, with preprocessing steps, feature scaling, and model training included. 
Conclusion:
Overall, the document outlines a machine learning project focused on recommending suitable crops based on environmental factors, with preprocessing steps, feature scaling, and model training included.
In conclusion, both KNN and Logistic Regression are reasonable choices for the given dataset. It's essential to experiment with both are the best performance based on evaluation metrics.
